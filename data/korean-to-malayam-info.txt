Below is a guide that lists each Korean “jamo” (letter) with its standard romanization together with a suggested “closest‐approximation” in Malayalam. Keep in mind that the two languages have different phonemic inventories and writing systems, so the Malayalam letters shown here are only approximate; in several cases there is no perfect equivalent. In what follows, each entry gives:

- **Korean Letter & Sound (romanization)**
- **Closest Malayalam equivalent** (using the corresponding vowel or consonant letter or a geminated form when needed)
- **A Korean example word** (with its meaning)
- **A Malayalam example word** that features the approximate sound (with its meaning)
- **English translation** of the example

Some of the vowels (especially the “gliding” vowels such as ㅕ and ㅢ) have no true equivalent in Malayalam; in those cases a notional approximation is offered and noted.

## I. Vowels

1. **ㅏ – “a”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** അ  
   - **Korean example:** 아빠  
     *(“appa” – “dad”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** അച്ഛൻ  
     *(“achchan” – “father”)*  
   - **English:** “dad/father”  
   &nbsp;  
2. **ㅑ – “ya”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** യാ  
     > (Malayalam does not use an independent “ya” vowel; here we show the consonant യ with the long vowel sign, to give a [ya] sound.)  
   - **Korean example:** 야  
     *(An informal exclamation “hey!”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** യാത്ര  
     *(“yaathra” – “journey”; note the initial “ya” sound)*  
   - **English:** “hey” / “journey”  
   &nbsp;  
3. **ㅓ – “eo”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** While Korean ㅓ is pronounced like the open-mid vowel [ʌ] (as in “cup”), Malayalam does not have an exact match. Often the short “o” (ഒ) is used as a rough stand‑in.  
   - **Korean example:** 어른  
     *(“eoreun” – “adult”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ഒരാൾ  
     *(“oraal” – “a person”)*  
   - **English:** “adult” / “one (person)”  
   &nbsp;  
4. **ㅕ – “yeo”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** There is no true equivalent. One might indicate the glide with a combination such as യൊ (a not‐standard combo) to signal “yeo.”  
   - **Korean example:** 여자  
     *(“yeoja” – “woman”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** No common word begins with an exact “yeo” sound; one must approximate using a “y”–initial syllable (for example, യേശു “Yeshu” begins with “ye,” though not “yeo”).  
   - **English:** “woman”  
   &nbsp;  
5. **ㅗ – “o”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** Generally ഒ (for a short “o”) or ഓ (for a long “o”)  
   - **Korean example:** 오리  
     *(“ori” – “duck”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ഒന്ന്  
     *(“onnu” – “one”)*  
   - **English:** “duck” / “one”  
   &nbsp;  
6. **ㅛ – “yo”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** യോഗ (using the vowel sign for “o”) gives **യോ** for a [yo] sound  
   - **Korean example:** 요리  
     *(“yori” – “cooking” or “food”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** യോഗ  
     *(“yoga” – a Sanskrit‐derived word used in Malayalam)*  
   - **English:** “food” / “yoga”  
   &nbsp;  
7. **ㅜ – “u”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ഉ  
   - **Korean example:** 우유  
     *(“uyu” – “milk”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ഉപ്പ്  
     *(“uppu” – “salt”)*  
   - **English:** “milk” / “salt”  
   &nbsp;  
8. **ㅠ – “yu”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** Typically approximated by using the letter for “ya” with the vowel ഉ, i.e. യൂ  
   - **Korean example:** 유리  
     *(“yuri” – “glass”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** യുവാവ്  
     *(“yuvāv” – “young man”)*  
   - **English:** “glass” / “young”  
   &nbsp;  
9. **ㅡ – “eu”**  
   - **Malayalam note:** This sound is a close central unrounded vowel ([ɯ]) with no true counterpart in Malayalam. It is sometimes approximated by a “neutral” vowel sound; one may have to note it as a special case.  
   - **Korean example:** 음악  
     *(“eumak” – “music”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** No exact equivalent; the inherent vowel in Malayalam (which may sound like a short “a” or schwa) is used instead.  
   - **English:** “music”  
   &nbsp;  
10. **ㅣ – “i”**  
    - **Malayalam equivalent:** ഇ  
    - **Korean example:** 이름  
      *(“ireum” – “name”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** ഇടം  
      *(“idam” – “place” or “gap”)*  
    - **English:** “name” / “place”  
    &nbsp;  
11. **ㅐ – “ae”**  
    - **Malayalam approximation:** The sound (as in “cat”) has no perfect equivalent. Often the vowel എ (or occasionally a diphthongal rendition) is used as an approximation.  
    - **Korean example:** 애인  
      *(“aein” – “lover”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** എനിക്ക്  
      *(“enikku” – “to me”; note the initial “e” sound)*  
    - **English:** “lover” / “me”  
    &nbsp;  
12. **ㅒ – “yae”**  
    - **Malayalam approximation:** One may notate this as a combination such as യെ (a “ya” plus the vowel sound of എ) even though this is not standard in Malayalam.  
    - **Korean example:** 얘  
      *(“yae” – a colloquial term for “kid” or “this one”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** No common native word uses this exact glide; it remains an approximation.  
    - **English:** “kid/this”  
    &nbsp;  
13. **ㅔ – “e”**  
    - **Malayalam equivalent:** എ  
    - **Korean example:** 세상  
      *(“sesang” – “world”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** എല്ലാം  
      *(“ellaam” – “all”)*  
    - **English:** “world” / “all”  
    &nbsp;  
14. **ㅖ – “ye”**  
    - **Malayalam equivalent:** Approximated by യേ  
    - **Korean example:** 예술  
      *(“yesul” – “art”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** യേശു  
      *(“Yeshu” – “Jesus”, a common proper noun in Malayalam)*  
    - **English:** “art” / “Jesus”  

---

## II. Double Vowels

1. **ㅘ – “wa”**  
   - **Malayalam note:** Korean “wa” is a combination of ㅗ + ㅏ. Malayalam does not have a distinct “w” sound; often the letter വ is used (which in Malayalam can represent both /v/ and, in loan contexts, /w/). A close approximation is writing വ + appropriate vowel sign, here envisioned as “വ” with an “a” quality.  
   - **Korean example:** 과일  
     *(“gwail” – “fruit”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** വാതില്‍  
     *(“vaathil” – “door”)*  
   - **English:** “fruit” / “door”  
   &nbsp;  
2. **ㅝ – “wo”**  
   - **Malayalam note:** Similarly, ㅝ (pronounced roughly “wuh”) is approximated by using വ plus an appropriate vowel sign (for instance, one might write വോ even though the quality is not exact).  
   - **Korean example:** 원  
     *(“won” – the name of the Korean currency or “circle”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** There is no common native word beginning with a true “wo–” sound; one must use the approximate വോ in transliterations.  
   - **English:** “won” / “circle”  
   &nbsp;  
3. **ㅙ – “wae”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** One might approximate this by a compound such as വ + an “e” vowel sign (for example, writing it as വൈ in transliteration even though the exact quality differs).  
   - **Korean example:** 왜  
     *(“wae” – “why”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** While not exact, the word യാത്ര (yaathra) sometimes appears with a diphthongal quality; however, there is no standard native example.  
   - **English:** “why”  
   &nbsp;  
4. **ㅞ – “we”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Often rendered with the consonant വ plus the vowel sign for “e” (വെ).  
   - **Korean example:** 웨이터  
     *(“weiteo” – “waiter”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** വെള്ളം  
     *(“vellam” – “water”)*  
   - **English:** “waiter” / “water”  
   &nbsp;  
5. **ㅚ – “oe”**  
   - **Malayalam note:** Modern Korean ㅚ is typically pronounced very similarly to ㅙ or even ㅟ; there is no true equivalent in Malayalam. An approximation might be attempted by combining vowels (for example, ഒയ) but it is not standard.  
   - **Korean example:** 외국  
     *(“oeguk” – “foreign country”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** No common example; this sound is generally rendered by borrowing the nearest available vowels.  
   - **English:** “foreign”  
   &nbsp;  
6. **ㅟ – “wi”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Often approximated by the consonant വ with the vowel sign for “i” (വി), even though the Korean “wi” begins with a “w” quality.  
   - **Korean example:** 위  
     *(“wi” – “above” or “top”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** വിഷു (Viṣu) is a proper name (of the deity), showing the “vi–” sound; also, various loanwords use വി to represent similar sounds.  
   - **English:** “above”  
   &nbsp;  
7. **ㅢ – “ui”**  
   - **Malayalam note:** This vowel—often pronounced like a diphthong “eui” or “ui”—has no true equivalent in Malayalam. It is usually rendered by a combination (for example, writing it as ഉയ്) but this is only a notational aid.  
   - **Korean example:** 의자  
     *(“uija” – “chair”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** No exact native equivalent exists.  
   - **English:** “chair”

## III. Consonants

### A. Plain Consonants

1. **ㄱ – “g” (or unaspirated “k”)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** Typically represented by ക  
     > (Though the Korean sound lies between [g] and [k], in Malayalam the unaspirated velar stop is usually written with ക.)  
   - **Korean example:** 가  
     *(“ga” – used as a syllable or as the name of the song “가요”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** കമലം  
     *(“kamalam” – “lotus”)*  
   - **English:** “lotus”  
   &nbsp;  
2. **ㄷ – “d” (often a [t] sound in initial position)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** Often approximated by ദ  
     > (Korean ㄷ is an unaspirated dental/alveolar stop; Malayalam ദ comes closest to the voiced equivalent.)  
   - **Korean example:** 다리  
     *(“dari” – “bridge” or “leg”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ദർശനം  
     *(“darshanam” – “sight” or “vision”)*  
   - **English:** “bridge” / “vision”  
   &nbsp;  
3. **ㅈ – “j”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ജ  
   - **Korean example:** 자  
     *(“ja” – meaning “sleep” in the verb 자다 “jada”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ജലം  
     *(“jalam” – “water” in Sanskrit-derived vocabulary)*  
   - **English:** “sleep” / “water”  
   &nbsp;  
4. **ㅂ – “b” (or unaspirated “p”)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ബ  
   - **Korean example:** 바다  
     *(“bada” – “sea”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ബാലന്  
     *(“baalan” – “child”)*  
   - **English:** “sea” / “child”  
   &nbsp;  
5. **ㅇ – “ng” (as a final sound; silent when initial)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** For the final nasal, the letter ങ (nga) is used.  
   - **Korean example:** 방  
     *(“bang” – “room”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** In transliterations the nasal sound is rendered with ങ, for example in അങ്ങ് (aṅṅ – “there”)  
   - **English:** “room”  
   &nbsp;  
6. **ㄴ – “n”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ന  
   - **Korean example:** 나  
     *(“na” – “I” or “me”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** നട  
     *(“nata” – “actor/performer”, or more simply, ന in many words)*  
   - **English:** “I”  
   &nbsp;  
7. **ㅅ – “s”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** സ  
   - **Korean example:** 사과  
     *(“sagwa” – “apple”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** സർിത  
     *(“sarita” – “river”; note that in Malayalam poetry and Sanskrit loans, സ is used for the “s” sound)*  
   - **English:** “apple” / “river”  
   &nbsp;  
8. **ㅁ – “m”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** മ  
   - **Korean example:** 마음  
     *(“maeum” – “heart” or “mind”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** മരം  
     *(“maram” – “tree”)*  
   - **English:** “mind” / “tree”  
   &nbsp;  
9. **ㅎ – “h”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ഹ  
   - **Korean example:** 하늘  
     *(“haneul” – “sky”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ഹരി  
     *(“Hari” – a common proper name invoking Lord Vishnu)*  
   - **English:** “sky” / “Hari”  
   &nbsp;  
10. **ㄹ – “r/l”**  
    - **Malayalam note:** Korean ㄹ is a flap that can sound like [r] or [l] depending on position. In Malayalam the lateral approximant is usually ല (la) or sometimes റ (ra) in a trilled quality.  
    - **Korean example:** 라면  
      *(“ramyeon” – “noodle soup/ramen”)*  
    - **Malayalam example:** ലക്ഷ്യം  
      *(“lakshyam” – “aim/goal”, using ല for the lateral sound)*  
    - **English:** “ramen” / “goal”  

---

### B. Aspirated Consonants

1. **ㅋ – “k” (aspirated)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** While Malayalam does not systematically distinguish aspiration, the aspirated sound is sometimes notated by using ഖ (the aspirated counterpart of ക).  
   - **Korean example:** 카드  
     *(“kadeu” – “card”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** ഖടകം  
     *(“khaṭakam” – a word sometimes used in poetic contexts, roughly “thunder”)*  
   - **English:** “card” / “thunder”  
   &nbsp;  
2. **ㅌ – “t” (aspirated)**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** Aspirated [tʰ] is not a native phoneme in Malayalam; one typically uses ത for a plain [t].  
   - **Korean example:** 타다  
     *(“tada” – “to ride” or “to burn”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** While a distinct aspirated [t] is not marked, words like തപിക്കുക (tapikkuka – “to burn”) use the same consonant ത.  
   - **English:** “ride” / “burn”  
   &nbsp;  
3. **ㅊ – “ch”**  
   - **Malayalam equivalent:** ച  
   - **Korean example:** 차  
     *(“cha” – “tea” or “car”)*

     *(“pado” – “wave”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** പാല്  
     *(“paal” – “milk”)*  
   - **English:** “wave” / “milk”  

---

### C. Tense (Fortis) Consonants

> These five are pronounced with extra muscular tension (sometimes written as “double” sounds). Malayalam does not have a built‑in set of tense stops; a common workaround in transliteration is to show them as geminated (doubled) consonants.

1. **ㄲ – “kk”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Represented by a doubled ക (i.e. ക്ക)  
   - **Korean example:** 까만  
     *(“kkaman” – “black”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** In transliterations one might write a geminated “ക്ക” to indicate tension, though no standard native word uses a “tense” sound.  
   - **English:** “black”  
   &nbsp;  
2. **ㄸ – “tt”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Represented by a doubled dental consonant (ട്ട)  
   - **Korean example:** 따뜻하다  
     *(“ttatteuthada” – “warm”)  
   - **Malayalam example:** Gemination is indicated in loanwords; one might notate a tense sound as in examples like “പട്ട” (as in “leather”) though it is only an approximation.  
   - **English:** “warm”  
   &nbsp;  
3. **ㅉ – “jj”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Represented by a doubled ജ (ജ്ജ)  
   - **Korean example:** 짜다  
     *(“jjada” – “salty”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** In transliteration one may show this as “ജ്ജ”, though native words rarely use a doubled ജ.  
   - **English:** “salty”  
   &nbsp;  
4. **ㅃ – “pp”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Represented by a doubled ബ (ബ്ബ)  
   - **Korean example:** 빨리  
     *(“ppalli” – “quickly”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** Again, gemination is used only in transliteration; one might render a tense “p” as ബ്ബ in academic notation.  
   - **English:** “quickly”  
   &nbsp;  
5. **ㅆ – “ss”**  
   - **Malayalam approximation:** Represented by a doubled സ (സ്സ)  
   - **Korean example:** 싸다  
     *(“ssada” – “cheap”)*  
   - **Malayalam example:** In transliterated text a tense “s” might be shown as “സ്സ”.  
   - **English:** “cheap”  

---

### Final Notes

- **Approximation Caveat:**  
  Because Korean and Malayalam evolved in very different linguistic environments, many Korean sounds (especially the centralized vowel ㅡ, the gliding vowels ㅕ/ㅒ/ㅢ, and the tense stops) have no one‑to‑one equivalent in Malayalam. The representations above use the nearest available letters or common transliteration practices.  
- **Usage Examples:**  
  The example words are chosen to illustrate the sound in each language; they are not meant to be “translations” of one another but rather to show how the same sound (or its closest approximation) is represented and used in Korean and Malayalam.  

We hope this guide helps you see how the Korean letters (jamo) might be rendered using Malayalam’s script and sound–values.
